# Personality Type

I'm an **Advocate \(INFJ\)** so I have the [Introverted](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted), [Intuitive](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant), [Feeling](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling), and [Judging](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting) personality traits. If you want to take the test you can go to [16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com/) and take the free, 12-minute test! I found it eye-opening to learn more about myself and my strengths and weaknesses.
