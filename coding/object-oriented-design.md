# Object-Oriented Design

These are notes taken from a physical copy of the book "Practical Object-oriented Design: An Agile Primer Using Ruby, Second Edition" by Sandi Metz.

## Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Design

* the world is procedural \(e.g. time flows forward and events pass by\) but it is also object-oriented \(e.g. objects have their own behavior\)
* new arrangements of behavior emerge naturally from a world of objects
* object-oriented software treats the world as a series of interactions between objects
* you need to shift from thinking of the world as pre-defined events to modelling the world as a series of messages that pass between objects
  * this is object-oriented design \(OOD\)
