# Version Control

The only website that I use to back up my software source code is [**GitHub**](https://github.com/paulinakhew). Check out my account [here](https://github.com/paulinakhew)! My main goal for my GitHub account is to make at least one commit every day. Symbolically, this commit represents change and growth as I improve upon my software and create more projects.
