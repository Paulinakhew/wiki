### Learn by Practice

Here is a list of my coding accounts on various websites that I use to train for coding interview questions. Go check them out!

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/paulinakhew/) - the world's leading online programming learning platform
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/paulinakhew12345?hr_r=1) - a technology hiring platform used to assess developer skills
* [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@paulinakhew) - a platform for technical recruitment that has programming challenges and coding competitions

### Version Control

The only website that I use to back up my software source code is [**GitHub**](https://github.com/paulinakhew). Check out my account [here](https://github.com/paulinakhew)! My main goal for my GitHub account is to make at least one commit every day. Symbolically, this commit represents change and growth as I improve upon my software and create more projects. 

### Hackathons

Hackathons are events that bring the software developer community together. "Hackers" pitch ideas and then turn these ideas into apps and products. Below are links to my profiles on websites used to find future hackathons as well as peruse previous hackathon projects.  

* [Devpost](https://devpost.com/Paulinakhew?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav) - a place to view hackathon projects
* [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@paulinakhew) - has hackathons ranging from university level hackathons to hackathons for enterprises
