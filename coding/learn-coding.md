# Learn Coding

### Learn by Practice

Here is a list of my coding accounts on various websites. The purpose of these websites range from coding practice to online hackathons. Go check them out!

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/paulinakhew/) - the world's leading online programming learning platform
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/paulinakhew12345?hr_r=1) - another online programming learning platform
* [Devpost](https://devpost.com/Paulinakhew?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav) - the home for hackathons
* [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@paulinakhew) - has coding problems as well as online and and in-person hackathons

### Version Control

The only website that I use to back up my software source code is [**GitHub**](https://github.com/paulinakhew). Check out my account [here](https://github.com/paulinakhew)! My main goal for my GitHub account is to make at least one commit every day. Symbolically, this commit represents change and growth as I improve upon my software and create more projects.
